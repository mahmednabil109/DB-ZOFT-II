# TODOs
- [ ]  Makinng Constants Class to easy access and modify `string constatns`
- [ ]  Test the Deserialization of stored tables 
- [x]  cache the `min` , `max` & `size` of the data in the page object
- [x]  implement the `_defragment` functionality in the Table class
- [ ] test the  `_searchRows` & `_searchPages` 

# Questions
- [ ] Do we need to keep the records continous?
- [ ] if not do we need to handle the defragmentation after the delete?
- [ ] if there were not keys to match with in the delete do we delete the whole table?
