# DBApp Project

> NOTES to test this project

* if you want to allow dublicates in the clustring key set the `ALLOW_DUBLICATE` in the DBApp Class to `true`
* the way we implement the logic of pages is that each table would have it's own directory with its name so __between tests please delete this directories to avoid getting DBAppException as you are creating tables that are already exists the tables already exists__
